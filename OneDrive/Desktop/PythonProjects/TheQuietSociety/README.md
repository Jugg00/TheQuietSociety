# The Quiet Society

A Python text-based investigation game where you uncover the secrets of a mysterious student organization on campus.

## Game Description

In *The Quiet Society*, you play as a college student who hears rumors of a secret organization. Some say they help students, others say they control things quietly. Your goal is to **gather evidence** — documents, photos, and recordings — to determine whether the organization is malicious before time runs out.

The game features:
- A cinematic opening scene
- Random events that can help or hinder your investigation
- Inventory management for collected evidence
- Multiple ways to gather clues and uncover the truth
- A win/lose condition based on your choices

## Objective

Collect at least **two strong pieces of evidence** and confront the organization before your moves run out. Choose your actions wisely, as some activities waste time or may trigger unexpected events.

## How to Play

1. Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the `TheQuietSociety` file.
3. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   python TheQuietSociety.py
